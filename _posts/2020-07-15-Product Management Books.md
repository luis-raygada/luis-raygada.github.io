<h5>What books I found useful in my Product Manager Journey.</h5>
<br>
<p>Currently, the amount of free online information is inversely proportional to its usability. Product Management roles faces more competition and must have a broad subset of skills. 
</p>

<p>One of the things I believe is learning by doing, so why not just pick up a good book and start learning. I want to share a list of basic books to help you in your Product Manager journey.</p>>
